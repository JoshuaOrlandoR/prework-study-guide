# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

This Prework Study Guide was developed as a learning tool for someone new to web development. It acts as both a reference to important web development principles as well as an example of web development. 

Please note, there was an error in the file directories, you'll need to navigate into prework study guide --> prework study guide --> prework study guide to get to the proper web page. This is due to the fact that I was hesitant to delete directories incase the file was affected in any way. 
I will keep this in mind and make sure it doesn't happen again in the future!

Through this project I got familiar with HTML, CSS, GIT, and Javascript, in order to build my foundation for the future. 

## Installation

No installation needed!

## Usage

This guide can be built up and more notes can be added in the future, through the use of GitBash and Visual studio. Refer to each section to understand what to study, and add onto it whenever something new, interesting, or useful pops up!
